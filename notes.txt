Cargo First Steps - Versioning
https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-version-field

cargo build - builds binary
cargo run - runs binary or builds and runs if not built already
cargo check - checks crate compiles without building
cargo build --release - builds a release version. This version takes longer to compile, but runs faster.
